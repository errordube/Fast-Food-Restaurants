# 2. Data Cleaning 

## a. Merging Datasets
## Already did above 

## b. Date/Time Manipulation

## lubridate is primarily designed for handling dates and times, it can also be used for simple year manipulation by converting the year into a complete date object with a fixed month and day.

```{r }
finalData <- finalData %>% mutate(Date = make_datetime(year = year, month = 01, day = 01))
head(finalData$Date)
```

## c. String Manipulation

```{r }

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r }
skim(finalData)

#Out of Total 229301 observations
#5 median_income are missing - Mainly because it was was not recorded or not available for those specific locations.
#8 prop_poverty are missing - Mainly because it was was not recorded or not available for those specific locations.

#My Observation:
#Missing data can impact summary statistics by reducing sample sizes and potentially biasing the results. Visualizations may also be affected if missing values are not handled appropriately, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate representations of the data.
```

            min_median_income = min(median_income),
            max_median_income = max(median_income))

# Keep only the 5 rows with the maximum values of 'mean_median_income' for each province
summary_stats_income_5 <- summary_stats_income %>%
  slice_max(n = 5, order_by = mean_median_income)

# Round the summary statistics to two decimal places

# 4. Monte Carlo Methods of Inference

```{r }
##  A Monte Carlo simulation using the One-Way ANOVA model

## Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the average number of locations for the different restaurant names across the states in the United States.

## Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):There is a difference in the average number of locations for the different restaurant names across the states in the United States.

set.seed(1994)

# Step 1: Create a new data frame with counts of restaurant locations in each state for each restaurant name
restaurant_counts <- finalData %>%
  group_by(name, province) %>%
  summarise(num_locations = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 2: Subset to restaurants with a sufficiently large number of locations in every state
min_locations_per_state <- 5  # Set the minimum number of locations per state
restaurant_counts_subset <- restaurant_counts %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(all(num_locations >= min_locations_per_state)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 3: Perform One-Way ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(num_locations ~ name, data = restaurant_counts_subset)

# Step 4: Extract the F-statistic from the ANOVA result
f_statistic <- summary(anova_result)[[1]]$`F value`

# Step 5: Create a null distribution of F-statistics using Monte Carlo simulation
num_permutations <- 1000  # Increase the number of permutations
null_distribution <- numeric(num_permutations)

for (i in 1:num_permutations) {
  # Step 5a: Shuffle the num_locations randomly between different restaurant names
  shuffled_counts <- restaurant_counts %>%
    mutate(name_shuffled = sample(name)) %>%
    group_by(name_shuffled, province) %>%
    summarise(num_locations_shuffled = sum(num_locations)) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Step 5b: Perform One-Way ANOVA for the shuffled data and extract the F-statistic
  null_anova_result <- aov(num_locations_shuffled ~ name_shuffled, data = shuffled_counts)
  
  # Step 5c: Extract the F-statistic from the shuffled ANOVA result
  null_f_statistic <- summary(null_anova_result)[[1]]$`F value`
  
  # Step 5d: Check if the F-statistic is present in the summary (in case it's not available for some permutations)
  if (!is.null(null_f_statistic)) {
    null_distribution[i] <- null_f_statistic
  }
}

# Step 6: Remove any NA values from the null distribution
null_distribution <- null_distribution[!is.na(null_distribution)]

# Calculate the 5th percentile of the null distribution
null_5th_percentile <- quantile(null_distribution, 0.05)

# Step 7: Plot the null distribution of F-statistics
comparison_plot_f <- ggplot(data.frame(F_statistic = null_distribution), aes(x = F_statistic)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = alpha("lightblue", 0.7), color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = null_5th_percentile, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = f_statistic, color = "blue", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(x = "F-statistic",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Null Distribution of the F-statistic in One-Way ANOVA") +
  theme_bw()

# Convert the plot to an interactive plot using plotly
interactive_plot_one_way <- ggplotly(comparison_plot_f)

# Display the interactive plot
interactive_plot_one_way
```
## Interpretation:
## The red dashed vertical line represents the 5th percentile value of the null distribution of F-statistics.
## This value is the threshold below which only 5% of the F-statistics from the random permutations fall.
## It serves as the critical value for determining statistical significance.

## The blue solid vertical line represents the observed F-statistic obtained from the original data.
## This value is calculated from the One-Way ANOVA comparing the average number of locations for different
## restaurant names across the states.

## Comparing the observed F-statistic to the critical value at the 5th percentile, we draw the following conclusions:

## - The observed F-statistic is greater than the critical value.
## - The observed F-statistic falls in the right tail of the null distribution.

## Therefore, based on the observed F-statistic and its comparison with the 5th percentile of the null distribution,
## we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are differences in the average number of locations
## for different restaurant names across the states in the United States.

# 5. Bootstrap Methods of Inference

```{r }
# Problem Statement:
# The objective of this analysis is to estimate the median income for a specific dataset ("finalData") using the bootstrap method of inference. We want to determine the uncertainty associated with the median income estimate and construct a 95% confidence interval for the true median income. Additionally, we aim to visualize the distribution of bootstrap medians and compare it to the observed median income to assess the representatives of the observed estimate.


#Removing missing values from median_income
median_income_cleaned <- na.omit(finalData$median_income)

#Calculating the median of a bootstrap sample
bootstrap_median <- function(x) {median(sample(x, replace = TRUE))}

#setting seed
set.seed(123456)
#Generating bootstrap samples while calculating the median of them
bootstrap_median <- replicate(10000, bootstrap_median(median_income_cleaned))

#Calculating the standard error
SE <- sd(bootstrap_median)

#Calculating the 95% confidence intervals
conf_interval <- 0.95
lower_bound <- quantile(bootstrap_median, probs = (1 - conf_interval )/ 2)
upper_bound <- quantile(bootstrap_median, probs = 1 - (1 - conf_interval)/ 2)

#Generating Histogram of the distribution
data_frame <- data.frame(bootstrap_median)
hist_plot <- ggplot(data_frame, aes(x = bootstrap_median)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lower_bound, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = upper_bound, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(median_income_cleaned), color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(x = "Median income",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Median Income Bootstrap Sample",
       subtitle = "Observed median income--dashed line")

# Convert the ggplot histogram to an interactive plot using plotly
interactive_bootstrap <- ggplotly(hist_plot)

# Display the interactive plot
interactive_bootstrap


```



## Interpretation:

## The histogram displays the distribution of bootstrap medians, generated by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data and calculating the median of each bootstrap sample. The observed median income is represented by the dashed black line on the histogram, which is located at approximately 54053.

## The bootstrap analysis results in a 95% confidence interval for the median income estimate. The lower bound of the confidence interval is 53979, and the upper bound is 54102. This means that we are 95% confident that the true median income in the population falls within the range of 53979 to 54102.


# 6. Conclusions / Main Takeaways:

## Top 5 Cities With Fast Food Restaurants - Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Houston, Miami, Denver.

## Top 5 most numerous fast food restaurants - McDonaldâ€™s, Taco Bell ,Subway ,Burger King, Arbyâ€™s.

## The line plot depicts the trend of fast food restaurants from 2008 to 2021. The number remained stable at around 17635 from 2009 to 2019. However, in 2020, it decreased to 9946, likely due to the pandemic. In 2021, the industry rebounded strongly, reaching 17662 restaurants. This demonstrates the fast food industry's resilience and adaptability to changing conditions.
